# AVAX_ADV__MOD-1



## Description
Over the course of this project, we have set up our own EVM Subnet using the Avalanche CLI, a powerful command-line interface for managing Avalanche blockchain networks. The principal aim of this endeavor is to utilize the innate potential of the Avalanche platform to construct a robust and expandable framework for decentralized applications, with a particular focus on Ethereum compatibility. The careful subnet configuration ensures smooth communication with current Ethereum tools and smart contracts, creating a strong foundation for the creation of decentralized applications. The indigenous token that I have designated is "Rish".
